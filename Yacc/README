Modification to Lex.l
	add some keywords.
	add yylval assignments.
	some structures and including "Yacc.tab.h"

	remove some unnecessary code. (still prints tokens, it is helpful when developing.)


Scanner usage:
the path of input file shall follow the execution command.( e.g. ./scanner test.sf)
you can append some argument to show more information. 
	-t shows each token
	-d shows each derive
	no arguements only prints comment in *.sf and error message.
file name must be the first place, the order of other arguments doesn't matter.
